My Name is ANSH PREM(2302CS01).
I've made this project for NSoC SPACE JAM(week 2).
The project is about an animation based on space.
In which Earth is rotating and moon is revolving around Earth.
And, I know my aspects are beyond the actual phenomena.
But This is just for idea of animations we can use to adore our project.
And to show what can we with html css.

And one thing more I made this animation without js file because I don't know why my js compiler is working well and was showing some glitches but I 've done all js scripting
in html file itself.
